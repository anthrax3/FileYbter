# Fileybter
Allows you to evade all Antivirus


<h2> Idea </h2>
- Convert a somefile that can not pass anti-virus  into bytes </br>
- initialize an array of byte with file-bytes in a program 
- Writinig these bytes to file 'x'
- Execute the program and program will execute the file   'x' 

<h2>
Guarantee </h2>
program will pass any AVS <br/>
x file will not 100% pass till you make The AVS busy with something</br>
if file executed 
 &nbsb;&nbsb;&nbsb;&nbsb; Process completed :D 
 
 
 <h2>Requirements</h2>
 Does not need any library it will works anywhere 
 
 <h2> Environment </h2>
 Windows OS  xp , vista ,7 ,8 ,8.1, 10


<h2> class </h2>
Has  4 Methods </br >
1- Reads all bytes of a file and return on a string format , each bytes separated with a whitespace 
<br > Takes one parameter "the path of  server file "
2- the same as 1st Method but returned result is an array of bytes initialization </br>
3- Third method takes two prameter the bytes to write and the file to write into , and a third optional to determine if the program deletes the server file after Execution or not 
4-  method to prevent multi-execution of the server which makes the os goes not responding 
</br> <h5> HOw ?? </h5>
using a small idea which takes  a paramer ID to save in a new file with the name of current user 
</br >
next execution  of a file 
<h5> What will happen ?</h5>
5- you can use the last method to determine if the program executed before or not , method will look for a file containig the name  of current user and the id , parameter :D
